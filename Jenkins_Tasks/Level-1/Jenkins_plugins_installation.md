# Question
The Nautilus DevOps team has recently setup a Jenkins server, which they want to use for some CI/CD jobs. Before that they want to install some plugins which will be used in most of the jobs. Please find below more details about the task:

**Click on the Jenkins button so, you should be able to access the Jenkins login page. Login using username `admin` and `Adm!n321` password.**

**Once logged in install `Git` and `GitLab` plugins. You might need to restart Jenkins service to install these plugins so we recommend clicking on Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running on plugin installation/update page i.e update centre.

Note:

You might need to install some plugins and restart Jenkins service. So, we recommend clicking on Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running on plugin installation/update page i.e update centre. Also some times Jenkins UI gets stuck when Jenkins service restarts in the back end so in such case please make sure to refresh the UI page.

Once you restart Jenkins service it will go down for some time so please wait for the Jenkins login page to come back before clicking on Finish.

Note: For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.
