# Question
An Ansible playbook needs completion on the jump host, where a team member left off. Below are the details: 
The inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory requires adjustments. The playbook must run on App Server 2 in Stratos DC. Update the inventory accordingly. 

Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml. Include a task to create an empty file /tmp/file.txt on App Server 2. 

Note: Validation will run the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml. Ensure the playbook works without any additional arguments.

✅ Step-by-Step Solution
1. Fix the inventory file

Open the file:

```vi /home/thor/ansible/inventory```


Replace its content with the correct info for App Server 2 (stapp02).

✔ Correct inventory content:
```stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_user=steve ansible_ssh_pass=Ir0nM@n ansible_become_pass=Ir0nM@n```

Important fixes:

Corrected IP → 172.16.238.11 (the real IP for stapp02 in Stratos DC)

Removed the broken ansible_ssh_common_args line

Added SSH password + become password (needed so the playbook works without extra arguments)

Save and exit.

2. Create the playbook file
```vi /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml```


Add the following content:

```
---
- name: Create file on App Server 2
  hosts: stapp02
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Create empty file
      file:
        path: /tmp/file.txt
        state: touch
```

Save and exit.

3. Run the playbook (for verification)

From inside /home/thor/ansible/:

```ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml```
